    "As we saw from the logistic regression yesterday, linear classifiers are often not the best at solving complicated problems. Neural networks introduce nonlinearity. They were originally developed as mathematical models of the information processing capabilities of biological brains, and were popular in the 80s and early 90s. Recently they have become popular again, especially as deep neural networks DNNs, including convolutional NNs (CNN), recurrent NNs (RNN), etc. \n",

    "A NN is made up of _neurons_ that receive multiple inputs, process them, and send the output to the neurons in the following layer. Here, the network is _dense_; every node of the hidden layer is connected to all previous and following nodes. \n",
    "The arrows indicate that information flows from left (the input) to the right (the output). Every arrow has an assigned weight that is a free parameter in the training of the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computing a series of weighted sums as is done by the above network is mathematically the same as computing just one weighted sum. An MLP with multiple linear hidden layers that all just sum up the inputs is thus equivalent to an MLP with a single linear hidden layer. To make this model more powerful than a linear model, a nonlinear function, the _activation function_, is applied to the weighted sum for each neuron in the hidden layer and used to determine the output that is propagated as input to the following neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of neurons in the output layer and the choice of _output activation function_ depend on the task the network is intended for. For binary classification tasks, a typical setup has a single output neuron with a logistic sigmoid activation.\n",
    "Large neural networks made up of many hidden layers of computation go under the term _deep learning_. Note that for dense layers, the number of parameters increases linearly in the number of hidden layers but quadratically in the number of neurons in each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train the NN, we have to determine the weight matrices $\\Theta^{(i)}$ (which are basically just a bookkeeping devices holding the weights of all input connections for all neurons of one layer each) that minimize the _cost function_. \n",
    "This is done using a method called _backpropagation_.\n",
    "The cost function of a NN is similar to what we have for logistic regression, modified to take into account possible multiple outputs, and with more complicated regularization."

    "\n",
    "Although the loss function of a neural network is typically highly non-convex with many local minima the optimization is typically performed via gradient descent. That means the parameters are updated step-by-step by following the gradient (steepest descent/ascent). The total cost function of the whole training dataset is the mean of the cost of each individual training example. This allows to perform a **stochastic gradient descent** (SGD) by calculating gradient updates only on a random subset (**batch**) of the training data. The advantages of this method are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* less computational effort for each gradient update since only a subset of examples has to be (back-)propagated through the network\n",
    "* less memory consumption\n",
    "* random fluctuations can help to escape local minima\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, typically more gradient steps are needed when the gradient is calculated from smaller batches and too small batch sizes can lead to large fluctuations of the loss value during training. As a consequence there is a trade-off between fast computation of each gradient step and the total number of gradient steps needed that is tuned by choosing the appropriate batch size. There are many improvements to the plain gradient descent that try to adjust the step sizes (**learning rate**) dynamically, possibly on a per-parameter-base. One of the most popular optimization algorithm currently (2019) is [Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980v8). A nice overview can be found at http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html or https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04747."
