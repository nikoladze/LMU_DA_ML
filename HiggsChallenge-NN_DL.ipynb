    "Another innovation we're introducing here is reweighting of the events. We are doing three things here:\n",
    "1. Applying event-based weights which are stored in `weight_train` (and `weight_test`). This helps to give more weight (in the computation of the loss function) to backgrounds events that have larger cross sections and are therefore more important to suppress than others.\n",
    "1. Reweighting the signal and background back such that their total weight is again about the same. Note that the unweighted sample has a ratio of about 1:2 for signal:background events, and we had seen that after applying the weight this ratio was reduced to about 1:500. Such a drastic difference in the weights can cause problems in the training, therefore we restore a roughly equal total weight by multiplying with the two (global) weights for signal and background we compute in `class_weight`.\n",
    "1. Normalizing the weights, such that the mean weight is 1. This avoids producing an overall shift in the loss value which would mean we also have to shift optimization parameters (like learning rate)."
